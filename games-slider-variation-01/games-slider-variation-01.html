Cascading wins unlock bottom rows, and xBomb Wilds remove symbols and increase the win multiplier. Non-winning horizontal matches add explosive wilds too, and the enhanced Streak Respins feature comes with 6 modifiers and potential payouts up to 60,000x.

                                    The Goddess Freya is one of the most powerful Norse Goddesses; gifted with an Amulet that allows her the ability to control the forces of sorcery, love and war. With all this power comes some disadvantages and limitations. Freya is also an emotional Goddess who will give or take away her favor at a whim, manipulating her forces to either work for you or against you.

                                    Quickspin’s dark-haired explorer apparently needed some time to recuperate after her last adventure, Ark Of Mystery, and she - and you - are in for a far more volatile expedition in this follow-up title called Dinosaur Rage. The seed of this game was planted with another Quickspin game however, namely Tiger's Glory. This is where the Pay Anywhere engine was first introduced, and it was all about enraged tigers.

This developer keeps pushing boundaries like few others, and even the theme of this game is somewhat unheard of. Parody prison slots exist in abundance, yes, but nothing with this kind of gritty realism has ever been let loose before.

                                    Join farmer Joe, who planted plastic and gold coins to grow crops of piggy banks. That’s the somewhat humorous backstory that suits the style of Piggy Bank Farm well, and there is always a certain satisfaction in smashing piggy banks. You’ll get plenty of that here, in both of the bonus rounds, as they are intimately intertwined with each other.
