				Intermediate Bonuses
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have a certain gambling experience behind your back, it might be safe for you to make a bigger deposit. Apart from the basic casino offers that we have already talked about, you may also take advantage of certain bonuses suitable for regular players. As usual, we recommend you always to read the bonus terms and conditions thoroughly to avoid any misunderstandings and gamble responsibly. Once you have made your deposit and feel ready to claim your bonus, <strong>there are four particular offers</strong> that you should keep an eye for:
			</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li class="deposit-reload">
						<strong>Deposit/Reload Bonus </strong> The deposit or reload bonuses are very similar to the welcome bonuses. Nevertheless, they are usually given at a lower percentage and given to existing members only. Generally speaking, reload bonuses should be seen as a way to reward loyal customers that cannot benefit from the welcome bonus anymore. One of the usual conditions for claiming a reload bonus is that the user has already made a deposit. The offer, however, is also subject to certain wagering conditions, which is why we recommend to read T&amp;C’s carefully and gamble responsibly. 
						<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" target="_blank" >CLAIM DEPOSIT BONUS!</a>
					</li>
					<li class="comp-points">
						<strong>Comp Points</strong> Comp points are another great way to reward and motivate regular players. They are usually earned by wagering on the casino or live casino games via desktop or mobile device. The comp point could be converted directly into cash and all active players can accumulate them. Every time you place a bet in your chosen casino, you gain comp points and it does not matter whether you win or lose! Most casinos would reward you with £1 for every 100 points you earn. The amount you could earn, however, is unlimited for most casino sites. 
						<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" target="_blank" >CLAIM COMP POINTS!</a>
					</li>
					<li class="freerolls">
						<strong>Freerolls</strong> Freeroll tournaments are currently offered by a small number of online casinos in the UK. If players enrol in free entry tournaments and win, they would only win. Nevertheless, there are a few factors that you should consider. The prize pool would usually be fixed and it will not change regardless of how many contestants enrol. Also, as you would most likely be competing against many other players, your chances to win will not be the highest. Most UK online casinos would include freerolls as a part of the exclusive perks for their VIP customers. 
						<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" target="_blank" >ENROL IN FREEROLLS!</a>
					</li>
					<li class="daily-deals">
						<strong>Daily Deals</strong> Many of the leading UK online casinos offer special daily deals for their regular customers. The operators would usually offer a different bonus for each day of the week. The only requirement to claim a daily bonus would usually be to make a deposit of a certain amount. Nevertheless, for some casinos, the requirement to claim a daily deal might be to play a particular game at a set time, for example, only for live games that if you deposit and play on a Tuesday. Remember that daily deals could also be subjects to wagering requirements. We recommend you to read the terms and conditions prior to claiming a bonus.

					</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				All four of the aforementioned bonuses are <strong>targeted towards regular, intermediate players.</strong> As we have discussed, they are suitable for bettors who have already used their welcome bonuses but still wish to gamble responsibly while benefitting from a great promotion. Most offers, however, might be subjects to certain conditions, which is why we recommend you to read the bonus terms and conditions thoroughly.
			</p>
			<p>
				One question might pop up in the minds of many – can you make a jump directly to intermediate bonuses? It all depends on whether you’ve taught yourself to gamble responsibly. We advise our player to <strong>first stick to the basic promotions</strong> like extra spins bonuses and all of the aforementioned beginner deals until they feel comfortable to step up their game. This way, not only will you be able to gain more experience, but you’ll also be able to improve your skills and set reasonable expectations for the future.
			</p>

				You should also <strong>be careful about the wagering of offers</strong> from <a href="#">online live roulette UK</a> casino sites and other live dealer games. And if you are not anymore a beginner, we are sure that you will enjoy bonuses that require a code in order to be claimed. If we are right, you might want to check our pages related to the <a href="#">bCasino bonus codes</a> and <a href="#">Betfred promo code offers</a> since we consider them to be among the best options out there!
