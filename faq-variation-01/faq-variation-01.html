                        <p>Deposit bonuses are cash rewards you receive when you put money into an online casino. Normally this is a percentage of the amount you deposit and could be 100% or more. Thus if you deposit €/£/$500 and are given a 100% deposit bonus, you will actually receive €/£/$1,000 in your account. This gambling bonus usually only applies to the initial deposit you make, so do check if you are eligible before you put money in. Most casinos also offer <a href="/bonus/free-spins/">free spins</a> and no deposit bonuses the more you play with them.</p>

                        <p>No, all regulated online slot machines are completely fair. The results are random every time, meaning that nothing in the game is rigged. To ensure fair play, only choose slots from approved online casinos, such as <a class="jumpto" href="#toplist">those we list on this page</a>. Playing at any of these will give you a fair chance of winning.</p>
