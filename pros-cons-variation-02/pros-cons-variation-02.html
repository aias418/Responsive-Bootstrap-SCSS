                <p class="main-title"> Paytable and Moon Princess Symbols </p>
                <p> Something that players may consider a flaw is that Moon Princess is a slot with only one payline. On a positive note, <strong>there are over 200 ways to win that one payline, giving players the thrill of what would happen next when there are winning combos</strong>. There are three princesses with different powers: Love is the princess that transforms symbols, princess Star adds wilds and princess Storm zaps away symbols like Zeus. When the three princesses unite in the grids, they open a Princess Trinity round, where you can double, even triple your winnings. </p>

                <p> Other symbols included in the game are the Moon, which acts as a Wild, a Bell, a Heart, a Star and a Green Medalion. You will also spot the three princesses – once in the grids and once on the side of the game, where they will use their powers to help you fill the Trinity symbol. There is no progressive jackpot, but there is a great multiplier that can increase your winnings up to 100 times. <strong>Betting limits start from £1 and go up to £20, with the maximum win reaching up to 100,000 coins or £100,000</strong>. </p>
